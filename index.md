Section: A09 - Learning Causal Knowledge for Advancing AI and Scientific Discovery
Mentors: Jelena Bradic and Biwei Huang

What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
**How we can apply causal discovery and utilize causal relationships to advance algorithms and things in the science field**

Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
**I would like to take advantage of causal inference to devleop reinforcement learning somehow.**

What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
**In our quarter 1 project we just attempted to take advantage of these relationships simply to improve efficiency of ML models. I'd like to take it to the next level and focus more on hpw we can improve Reinforcement Learning**

What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
**I'd like to make it more application based and potentially run other algorithms and/or explore what the algorithms themselves do. Also, I would like to have a bigger emphasis on how our project can be used in certain business cases.**
